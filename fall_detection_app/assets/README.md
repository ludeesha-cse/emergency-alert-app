# This is a placeholder for an alarm sound file

# In a real app, you would place an actual alarm.mp3 file here

# For testing purposes, you can:

# 1. Download a free alarm sound from freesound.org or similar

# 2. Convert it to .mp3 format

# 3. Place it in this assets/ directory

# 4. Name it "alarm.mp3"

# Recommended alarm sound characteristics:

# - Duration: 3-10 seconds

# - Volume: Loud and attention-grabbing

# - Format: MP3 or WAV

# - Frequency: High-pitched tones are more noticeable

# Alternative approach:

# The app can also use system default alarm sounds

# or generate tones programmatically if no asset is available
