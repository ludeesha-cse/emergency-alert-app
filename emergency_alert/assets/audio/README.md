# This is a placeholder file for emergency alarm sounds

# In a real implementation, you would place actual audio files here:

# - alarm_high.mp3 (high priority emergency alarm)

# - alarm_medium.mp3 (medium priority alert sound)

# - alarm_low.mp3 (low priority notification sound)

# For development, you can use any .mp3 or .wav files

# Example file names:

# - emergency_siren.mp3

# - alert_beep.mp3

# - notification_chime.mp3
