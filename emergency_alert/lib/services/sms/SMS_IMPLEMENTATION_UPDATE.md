# SMS Implementation Update

## Problem Solved

Previously, the SMS functionality was using `url_launcher` with `sms:` URI scheme, which only opened the messaging app with a pre-filled message but required the user to manually press the send button. This defeated the purpose of automatic emergency alerts.

## Solution Implemented

The SMS service has been updated to use the `flutter_sms` package which can send SMS messages directly without user intervention.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Dependencies

Added `flutter_sms: ^2.3.3` to `pubspec.yaml` for direct SMS sending capability.

### 2. Updated SMS Service

Modified `lib/services/sms/sms_service.dart`:

- **sendEmergencyAlert()**: Now uses `sendSMS()` function to send SMS directly to all emergency contacts automatically
- **sendTestMessage()**: Updated to send test messages automatically
- **sendCancellationMessage()**: Updated to send cancellation messages automatically

### 3. Fallback Strategy

The implementation includes a fallback mechanism:

1. **Primary**: Attempts to send SMS directly using `flutter_sms`
2. **Fallback**: If direct sending fails, falls back to the original `url_launcher` method

## Key Features

- **Automatic SMS Sending**: No user interaction required for emergency alerts
- **Multiple Recipients**: Sends to all enabled emergency contacts simultaneously
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback to manual SMS if automatic sending fails
- **Permission Handling**: Checks SMS permissions before attempting to send

## Permissions Required

The app requires the following SMS permissions (already configured in AndroidManifest.xml):

- `android.permission.SEND_SMS`
- `android.permission.READ_SMS`
- `android.permission.RECEIVE_SMS`

## Testing

To test the automatic SMS functionality:

1. Add emergency contacts in the app
2. Trigger a fall detection or use the panic button
3. The emergency SMS should be sent automatically without opening the messaging app
4. Check the emergency contacts' phones to verify message delivery

## Note

- Direct SMS sending may be restricted by some Android versions or device manufacturers
- The fallback mechanism ensures functionality even if direct sending is blocked
- Users should test the functionality on their specific device to ensure it works as expected
