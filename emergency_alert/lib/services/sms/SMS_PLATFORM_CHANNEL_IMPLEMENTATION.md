# SMS Platform Channel Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the platform channel implementation for automatic SMS sending in the Emergency Alert Flutter app. This implementation replaces the previous approach using third-party packages with a custom solution that directly interfaces with Android's SMS capabilities.

## Problem Solved

- **Previous Issue**: The app was using `url_launcher` with `sms:` URI scheme which only opened the messaging app with pre-filled text but required manual user intervention to send
- **Previous Attempts**: Third-party packages like `flutter_sms` and `telephony` had compatibility issues or were discontinued
- **Solution**: Custom platform channel implementation for direct SMS sending without user intervention

## Architecture

### Flutter Side (Dart)

**File**: `lib/services/sms/sms_service.dart`

Key components:

- `MethodChannel` for communication with native Android code
- `_sendDirectSMS()` method for platform channel calls
- Fallback mechanism using `url_launcher` if platform channel fails
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

### Android Side (Kotlin)

**File**: `android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/example/emergency_alert/MainActivity.kt`

Key components:

- Method channel handler for "sendSMS" calls
- `SmsManager` integration for direct SMS sending
- Support for multipart SMS messages (long messages)
- Permission checking and error handling

## Implementation Details

### SMS Service Methods Updated

1. **`sendEmergencyAlert()`**: Sends automatic emergency alerts to all enabled contacts
2. **`sendTestMessage()`**: Sends test messages to verify SMS functionality
3. **`sendCancellationMessage()`**: Sends cancellation messages when emergencies are resolved

### Platform Channel Flow

1. Flutter calls `_sendDirectSMS()` with message and phone numbers
2. Method channel invokes Android's "sendSMS" method
3. Android checks SMS permissions
4. `SmsManager` sends SMS directly to recipients
5. Success/failure result returned to Flutter
6. If platform channel fails, fallback to URL launcher

### Error Handling

- **Permission Denied**: Graceful fallback to URL launcher
- **Platform Channel Failure**: Automatic fallback mechanism
- **Individual SMS Failures**: Logged but doesn't stop batch sending
- **Network Issues**: Handled by Android SMS framework

## Permissions Required

### Android Manifest

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.SEND_SMS" />
```

Already configured in: `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`

## Key Benefits

1. **Automatic Sending**: No user intervention required for emergency SMS
2. **Reliable Fallback**: Falls back to URL launcher if platform channel fails
3. **Batch Processing**: Sends to multiple contacts simultaneously
4. **Long Message Support**: Automatically handles multipart SMS
5. **Maintainable**: Custom implementation under our control
6. **No External Dependencies**: Reduces third-party package conflicts

## Testing Requirements

### Pre-deployment Testing

1. **Device Testing**: Test on real Android device with SMS capability
2. **Permission Testing**: Verify SMS permissions are properly requested and handled
3. **Network Testing**: Test in various network conditions
4. **Fallback Testing**: Verify URL launcher fallback works when platform channel fails
5. **Emergency Flow Testing**: Test automatic SMS during actual fall detection

### Test Scenarios

- Emergency contact receives SMS automatically when fall is detected
- Test messages are sent successfully through contacts screen
- Cancellation messages are sent when emergency is resolved
- Fallback works when platform channel is unavailable
- Multiple contacts receive SMS simultaneously
- Long messages are properly split and sent

## Configuration

### Platform Channel Name

```dart
static const MethodChannel _channel = MethodChannel('com.emergency_alert/sms');
```

### Method Calls

- **Method**: "sendSMS"
- **Parameters**:
  - `message`: String - The SMS message content
  - `phoneNumbers`: List<String> - Array of recipient phone numbers

## Future Enhancements

1. **Delivery Reports**: Add SMS delivery confirmation
2. **iOS Support**: Implement iOS platform channel for SMS sending
3. **Retry Mechanism**: Add automatic retry for failed SMS
4. **Rate Limiting**: Implement SMS rate limiting to prevent abuse
5. **Template Management**: Add customizable SMS templates

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **SMS Permission Not Granted**: App will fallback to URL launcher
2. **Platform Channel Not Available**: Automatic fallback to URL launcher
3. **Invalid Phone Numbers**: Individual failures logged, batch continues
4. **Network Connectivity**: Handled by Android SMS framework

### Debug Information

- All SMS operations are logged with print statements
- Error messages include specific failure reasons
- Success/failure status returned for each operation

## Migration Notes

### Changes from Previous Implementation

- Removed dependency on `flutter_sms` and `telephony` packages
- Added platform channel implementation
- Enhanced error handling and fallback mechanisms
- Improved batch SMS sending capabilities

### Backward Compatibility

- Fallback to URL launcher maintains compatibility with previous behavior
- All existing method signatures preserved
- No breaking changes to calling code
